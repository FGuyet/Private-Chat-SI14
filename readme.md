# Private Chat - SI14

Small website made for an English class project.

We had a written project to do during the semester, in a group of 3 people, where we were asked to write e-mails to each others.

We decided to do it in a Chat conversation way, and I coded a mini-website so that it was easier for us to manage the order of the messages for the 3 people.

Our final version of the project can be read here : http://codetrotter.fr/si14/rendu.php
Loging in is required to edit and write new messages.
